# This monkey-patches the array class to catch plural method calls.
# It assumes we're running in a rails environment that provides us with
# String#singularize.
# The limitation that this method imposes on rails applications is
# that you cannot have a column with a name that collides with methods
# defined on Array (or on its ancestor).
# i.e. if you have a model named "Diary" with the column "entry", calling 
# Diary.entries will invoke the underlying Object#entries method.  This is 
# undesired behavior and it is up to the developer to wisely avoid these cases.

  # with objects that share the same attributes (Dog, Labrador < Dog for example) and follows ruby's
